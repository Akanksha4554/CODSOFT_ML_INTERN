CodSoft Internship Projects

# TASK 1:
# MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You
can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers
such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines.

# TASK 2:
# CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a
dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and
experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or
legitimate.

# TASK 3:
# CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription based service or business. Use historical customer data, including
features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try
algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient
Boosting to predict churn.

# TASK 4:
# SPAM SMS DETECTION
Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or
legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with
classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines to identify spam messages.
